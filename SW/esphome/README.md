# LaskaKit Weather Station Mini - ESPHome example configuration

This configuration works together with BME280 (temperature, humidity and atmosferic pressure) but feel free to add even more sensors. 

To get started, copy files in this folder to your ESPhome cofig, rename `common/secrets.yaml.sample` to `common/secrets.yaml` and edit all values in this file (wifi, api keys, etc.).
